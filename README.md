# Fake-news-detection
This project is a Fake News Detection Web Application that uses Machine Learning to classify news articles as either Real or Fake. It is built with Streamlit for the interactive user interface, and a Logistic Regression model trained on real-world datasets (True.csv and Fake.csv) using TF-IDF vectorization.
